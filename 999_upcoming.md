# Upcoming chapters

Other topics which are covered in the course, but the corresponding chapters are not yet online and are to appear:

[x] Surrogates
[x] Neural networks with Flax
[ ] Deep generative surrogates and PriorCVAE
[ ] Bayesian neural networks
[ ] So, why Numpyro?
[ ] Variational inference
[ ] Introduction to deep generative models
[ ] Variational autoencoders (VAEs), normalising flows (NFs)
[ ] Simulation-based inference

Further interesting topics which the course might not have time to cover (but I might add them to the online version in the future):

- Bayesian regularisation from optimisation perspective
- Laplace approximation
- Bayesian optimisation
- Active learning
- Renewal equation
- Hilbert Space Gaussian Process approximation (HSGP)
