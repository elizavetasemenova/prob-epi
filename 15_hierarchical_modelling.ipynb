        "Hierarchical structures are commonly found in both natural data and statistical models. These hierarchies can represent various levels of organization or grouping within the data, and incorporating them into Bayesian inference can provide more accurate and insightful results. Such approach to modelling allows to account for <font color='orange'>different sources of variation</font> in the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Priors of model parameters are the first level of hierarchy. Priors of model parameters can depend on other parameters, and new priors (<font color='orange'>hyperpriors</font>) are defined over these prior parameters. In this case, the hyperpriors would be the second level of hierarchy. Following this scheme, the structure can be extended to more levels of hierarchy. In principle, there is not a limited level of hierarchy.\n",
